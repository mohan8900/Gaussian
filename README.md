# Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting

## AIM:
To write a program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import numpy as np. 
2. From scipy import lu.
3. Get the input from the user.  
4. End the program.

## Program:
```

import numpy as np

n = int(input())
a = np.zeros((n,n+1))
x = np.zeros(n)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n+1):
        a[i][j] = float(input())
        
for i in range(n):
    if a[i][i] == 0.0:
        sys.exit('Divide by zero detected!')
        
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        ratio = a[j][i]/a[i][i]
        
        for k in range(n+1):
            a[j][k] = a[j][k] - ratio * a[i][k]
            
x[n-1] = a[n-1][n]/a[n-1][n-1]
        
for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
    x[i] = a[i][n]
    
    for j in range(i+1,n):
        x[i] = x[i] - a[i][j]*x[j]
        
    x[i] = x[i]/a[i][i]
    
for i in range(n):
    print('X%d = %0.2f' %(i,x[i]), end = ' ')

```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the Gaussian Elimination with partial pivoting of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
